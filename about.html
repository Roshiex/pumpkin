				<h3> ✨✨Pumpkin's background ✨✨ </h3>
				<p>Pumpkin is a female Tortoise Shell cat who was put up for adoption when she was about 1 year old. That was when I adopted her and took her in. From the beginning she has taken over my house, ruling her underlings (my other pets). You will find she is quite opinionated.
					<br>
					<br>
				On this website you can discover her opinions on food and geopolitics. How she has appeared through history and a special guest book for people to worship her how she deserves to be.</p>

				<p> The first glimpse of Pumpkin on show is her mugshot from when she was put up for adoption. Even from then she was very vocal and telling everyone what they were doing wrong </p>
